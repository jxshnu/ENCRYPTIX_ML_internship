Encryptix Machine Learning Internship Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Encryptix Machine Learning Internship. This repository contains three major projects that I completed as part of the internship program. Each project includes detailed code, datasets, and documentation.

Projects Overview
1. Movie Genre Classification
This project aims to predict the genre of movies based on their plot summaries.

Techniques Used: TF-IDF, Word Embeddings
Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Dataset: Kaggle - Genre Classification Dataset
Challenges:
Data preprocessing and handling missing values.
Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings.
Model selection and performance tuning.
2. Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project involves building a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

Techniques Used: Feature Engineering, Data Imbalance Handling
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
Dataset: Kaggle - Fraud Detection Dataset
Challenges:
Managing imbalanced datasets where fraudulent transactions are rare.
Creating and selecting features to enhance model accuracy.
Experimenting with various algorithms for optimal performance.
3. Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a subscription-based service.

Techniques Used: Data Analysis, Feature Engineering
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting
Dataset: Kaggle - Customer Churn Prediction Dataset
Challenges:
Understanding and preprocessing historical customer data.
Developing models to predict churn with high accuracy.
Ensuring model interpretability for business applications.
